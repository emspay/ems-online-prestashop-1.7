## Version number

## Pre-requisites to install the plug-ins: 
- PHP v5.4 and above
- MySQL v5.4 and above

## Installation
Manual installation of the PrestaShop 1.7 plugin using (s)FTP

1. Upload all of the folders in the ZIP file into the Modules folder of your PrestaShop installation (no files are transferred).
You can use an sFTP or SCP program, for example, to upload the files. There are various sFTP clients that you can download free of charge from the internet, such as WinSCP or Filezilla.
2. Go to your PrestaShop admin environment. Click ‘Improve' > 'Modules' > 'Module Catalog’ and search for EMS Online.
3. You will see several modules to be installed. Start with ‘EMS Online’. Click Install / Proceed with the installation.
After installation, the module will move to Improve' > 'Modules' > 'Module Manager’
4. Configure the EMS Online module
- Enable the cURL CA bundle option.
This fixes a cURL SSL Certificate issue that appears in some web-hosting environments where you do not have access to the PHP.ini file and therefore are not able to update server certificates.
- Leave the 'Include Webhook URL with every order' option enabled.
The plugin can automatically generate a webhook URL when a message is sent to the EMS API for new orders. To enable this option select ‘Include Webhook URL with every order’.
- Copy the API key
- Are you offering Afterpay on your pay page? In that case copy the API Key of your test webshop in the Afterpay Test API Key.
When your Afterpay application was approved an extra test webshop was created for you to use in your test with Afterpay. The name of this webshop starts with ‘TEST Afterpay’.
- Are you offering Klarna on your pay page? In that case copy the API Key of your test webshop in the Klarna Test API Key field.
When your Klarna application was approved an extra test webshop was created for you to use in your test with Klarna. The name of this webshop starts with ‘TEST Klarna’.

5. After you have installed the ‘EMS Online´ module, you can install the other modules you would like to offer in your webshop.
Enable only those payment methods that you applied for and for which you have received a confirmation from us.

Note that if a payment method has no specific configuration to be done apart from the ones in the generic configuration, the only option shown on the panel will be “Disable”/”Enable”.
The “configure” option is only shown in case the payment method has further configuration e.g. Klarna with IP Filtering.

6. Afterpay / Klarna specific configuration
For the payment method Afterpay / Klarna you can choose to offer it only to a limited set of whitelisted IP addresses. You can use this for instance when you are in the testing phase and want to make sure that Afterpay / Klarna is not available yet for your customers.
To do this click on the “Configure” button of EMS Online Afterpay or EMS Online Klarna in the payment method overview.

Enter the IP addresses that you want to whitelist, separate the addresses by a comma (“,”). The payment method Afterpay / Klarna will only be presented to customers who use a whitelisted IP address.
If you want to offer Afterpay / Klarna to all your customers, you can leave the field empty.

7. Once the modules are installed you can offer the payment methods in your webshop.
